My page is designed to inform future employers the design and functioning of what is to come. 

There are 3 extraordinary pages linked together to read more as well as connect and view additional projects and believe me there will be more as the journey continues in web development. 

    A little background about myself:
    Graduated with a Commercial Graphics degree in GIT (Graphics and Imaging Technology) at Pittsburg State University --Pittsburg, Kansas.
        Received Bachelor of Science in Technology 2004.

        Received a Master of Science, also from Pittsburg State University, in Technical Education 2005.

    The past 10 years have been devoted to an engraving company called Universal Engraving. There is where I obtained knowledge with texture, typography, and manipulation of artwork as a Production Artist. I am now seeking a career in Web Development through Kansas University.
