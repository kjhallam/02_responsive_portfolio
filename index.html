        It all began when Kenny and Sheryl met and they had me (Kendra Jolene Hallam). They never expected their lives to forever be changed by this little bundle of joy. She was the cutest baby ever step foot on this earth. (hahaha) She weighed 7lb and 9oz. She was the baby sister to Tristan Hallam. Who inevitably picked on her from day 1.

        We grew up playing on a small farm just outside Nevada, Missouri. There is where we played in the dirt, played basketball, road our bikes, threw rocks in the creek, and road (3-Wheelers) aka ATV's. We had cousins who were close in age and spent many hours chasing and playing tag with them at our grandparents house. Getting into mischief was our best trait as kids.

        The summer of 1994, only 12 years later, my parents had not 1 but 2 little girls. Yes--they were identical twins. We were all so excited to have 2 unique little babies in the family. We named them Toni & Tiffani. From that day forward our lives were forever changed once again.
